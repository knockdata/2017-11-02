In this graph, A, B can be combined. C, D, E can be combined<br>
Spark call it a stage<br>

Why it can be combined? <br>

Because it is linear<br>
If we put those action on the same machine<br>
then we even don't need send data over network<br>
You know network is slowwer, ... compare to memory<br><br>

How can I maximize benifit if I buy stocks? <br>
If I would know the price tomorrow<br>
then I would know what is the best share to buy<br><br>

The same principal applies here
