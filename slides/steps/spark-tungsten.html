<div class="notes">
It turns out there are a lot can do<br>

e.g. every string need 12 extra byte<br>
a character only need 1 byte<br>
even for language like chinese, only 2 bytes are needed<br><br>

for orignal spark, it could have 10x performance boost over Map Reduce<br>
And from Spark 2, it has another 10x boost<br>

So Spark 2 can have totally 100x time boost over Map Reduce<br><br>

What does this mean? <br><br>

It means I just go and have a take cup of coffee <br>
and the result will be there<br>
If I use Spark<br>

Or I can go home to get the result tomorrow morning<br>
with Map Reduce<br>

Now<br>
Let's come to a Hello World Example
